                <p>The funds can be used for anything at your discretion. Executors or trustees typically use an advance
                  to cover any estate debts, bills or expenses like mortgages or maintenance costs, and it can also be
                  used for funeral costs. An Inheritance Advance can also be used to maximize the value of the estate by
                  updating or renovating the estate property for a higher resale price. Beneficiaries use Inheritance
                  Advances in numerous ways including paying off bills or debt, down payments for new properties,
                  investments or personal expenditures.
